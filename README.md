# Scale for User Activity/Events and Push Notifications

From mobile applications that generate streams of event/location information to computerized manufacturing machines that send out vast amounts of data to big data applications mining real-time logs to generate business metrics & run the personalized push notifications

Thread-pool style, non-blocking, high-volume task, partitioning strategy for parallel nodes
scalable as when the new new is added to the cluster

The load balancer will distribute the traffic to the nodes

As new node is added, the load is distributed to the nodes in the cluster for all user activity events generating and runs the realtime.

personalized recommended notifications 

BlockingQueues, Producers, Consumers

Shutdown hooks for BlockingQueue and drain the queue to consume all the messages before stopping the threads

BulkNotifications, Scheduled Notification

Runtime Metrics through JMX

Micro-Services design for scale

#When to add new node to cluster
Measure the CPU utilization by increasing the number of threads one by one and stop when the CPU utilization reaches close to 90-100%

#AWS SNS for push Notifications
Bulk Push Notifications & real-time push notifications
