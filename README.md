From mobile applications that generate streams of event/location information to computerized manufacturing machines that send out vast 
amounts of data to big data applications mining real-time logs to generate business metrics & run the personalized push notifications

Thread-pool style, non-blocking, high-volume task, partitioning strategy for parallel nodes
scalable as when the new new is added to the cluster

The load balancer will distribute the traffic to the nodes

As new node is added the load is distributed for all user activity events gathering and runs the realtime 
personalized recommended notifications 

BlockingQueue, Producers, Consumers

Shutdown hooks for BlockingQueue and drain the queue to consume all the messages before stopping the threads
BulkNotifications, Scheduled Notification

Runtime Metrics through JMX

Micro-Services design for scale

When to add new node to cluster
Measure the CPU utilization by increasing the number of threads one by one and stop when the CPU utilization reaches close to 90-100%
